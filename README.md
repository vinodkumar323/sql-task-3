SQL Developer Internship - Task 3
Task Title:
Writing Basic SELECT Queries

Objective:
To extract and retrieve data from one or more tables using SQL SELECT statements. This task helps in understanding data filtering, projection, and sorting in SQL.

Tools Used:
DB Browser for SQLite
MySQL Workbench
Task Overview:
This task involved writing SQL scripts to:

Select specific and all columns using SELECT * and SELECT column_name
Filter rows using WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE, BETWEEN, IN
Sort results using ORDER BY
Limit output using LIMIT
Join multiple tables using JOIN
Use functions like DISTINCT, COUNT, GROUP BY, and aliasing
Key Concepts Applied:
Filtering: Narrowing down rows using conditional statements.
Projection: Selecting specific columns from a table.
Sorting: Arranging output using ORDER BY.
Joining: Combining data from multiple related tables.
Limiting: Restricting the number of rows in output.
What I Did:
Created two sample tables: employees and orders
Populated them with mock data relevant to real-world use cases
Wrote 18+ SQL queries covering:
Column selection
Conditional filtering
Pattern matching with LIKE
Range queries with BETWEEN
Sorting in ascending/descending order
Limiting results
Inner and left joins
Aliasing for better readability
Removing duplicates using DISTINCT
Grouping and counting rows
Outcome:
Through this task, I developed a clear understanding of:

Extracting meaningful data using SELECT queries
Applying different types of filters for data refinement
Organizing query output for analysis
Querying across multiple tables efficiently
Deliverables:
SQL script file containing all queries
README file documenting the task approach and outcomes
